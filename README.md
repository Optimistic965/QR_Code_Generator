## What it's all About?
Used this project as a refresher on my Js Skill, and Sass [still learning though] while getting introduced to GSAP.. 
The Project produce a Qr bar code base on the input the user provided.. It supports rendering of the bar code in differnt size base on what the user select, though 400x400 is the maximum size it can render..
